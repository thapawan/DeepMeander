# Overview
This study automates the extraction and classification of river meanders in the southeastern United States using deep learning models. The classification is based on geometric properties such as meander amplitude, meander wavelength, meander sinuosity, water-surface width, and Quantitative Width-Based Meander (QWBM).
# Deep Learning Models
- ResNet50
- ResNet152
